# Towards pgnotebook

Review pgcharts to make it an SQL notebook allowing its users to compose
"live" documents with SQL queries and their result, either plain tables or
charts.

Use [Hallo](http://hallojs.org/demo/markdown/) to allow editing text on the
note book document, and provide ways to save and reload any page.

A way to share a page *read-only* will then be needed, a simple HTML export
might be all we need here tho.
